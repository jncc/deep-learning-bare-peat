# deep-learning-bare-peat
  
Workflow to create deep learning models for assessing areas of bare peat in aerial imagery.
  
This code was written for aproof-of-concept project developed as part of the Data Science Accelerator Programme, aiming to explore mapping areas of bare peat in aerial photography using deep learning techniques.

This is building on previous methodologies conducted by JNCC using classical programming through derived indices and thresholding values and using shallow machine learning to classify images. These methods have demonstrated a lot of difficulty in distinguishing bare peat features from similar looking vegetation such as heather, or river courses with heavy sedimentation, and variability within the data between capture dates, capture conditions, image quality and regional variability. In this project, we trialled deep learning techniques in order to more accurately distinguish areas of bare peat in the imagery, making use of weakly labelled semantic segmentation models. This analysis can aid in the targeting of monitoring and restoration on the ground in peatland areas, providing a cost effective means of assessing visual indicators of the condition of upland peatlands.
